# cancer-data-analysis
Exploring cancer data and visualizing insights using Python. This repository contains code for loading, analyzing, and visualizing cancer rates from a dataset. Utilizing popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we aim to gain valuable insights into cancer prevalence across different demographics.
Cancer Data Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing cancer rates using real-world data. The dataset used for analysis includes comprehensive information on cancer rates across different states, age groups, sexes, and races.

Dataset Overview
The dataset provides insights into:

Total cancer rates by state
Age-wise cancer rates
Sex-wise cancer rates
Race-wise cancer rates
Key Insights
Total Cancer Rates by State: A boxplot visualization showcases the variation in cancer rates among different states, highlighting regions with higher or lower prevalence.
Age-wise Cancer Rates: Histograms illustrate the distribution of cancer rates across different age groups, enabling the identification of age-related patterns in cancer prevalence.
Sex-wise Cancer Rates: A bar plot presents the mean cancer rates for males and females, facilitating comparisons between the sexes.
Race-wise Cancer Rates: Another bar plot displays the mean cancer rates for various racial groups, shedding light on disparities in cancer prevalence across different racial demographics.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
